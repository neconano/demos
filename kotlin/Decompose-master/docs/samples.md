## Multi-Feature Sample App

This sample demonstrates the following features:

* Nested reusable components
* Bottom navigation
* Nested navigation
* State preservation (using `StateKeeper`)
* Retaining instances (using `InstanceKeeper`)
* Pluggable UI (Android Views, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, JS React)
* [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery) for Android
* Tests, including UI tests (Jetpack Compose)

Please note that Gradle files included in this sample project are not supposed to be used as a reference. They share the configuration with the reset of the library, which simplifies the maintenance a lot. Please refer to the [KMP documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html) for information on configuring a KMP project. You can also check other sample projects described below.

Content:

* [shared](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared) - this is a shared module that contains the following components:
    * [Root](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/root) - the root (top-most) component, it displays the bottom navigation bar and the currently selected tab.
    * [Counters](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters) - the Counters tab, contains a stack of `CounterComponent`.
        * [Counter](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters/counter) - contains `CounterComponent`, it just increments the counter every 250 ms. It starts counting once created and stops when destroyed. So `CounterComponent` continues counting while in the back stack, unless recreated. It uses the `InstanceKeeper`, so counting continues after Android configuration changes. The `StateKeeper` is used to preserve the state when the process is recreated on Android.
    * [Cards](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/cards) - the (draggable) Cards tab, contains a stack of [Card] components that can be dragged and thrown to the back of the stack. The top component is resumed and running, and components in the back stack are stopped. This sample demonstrates how the navigation can be controlled by gestures.
        * [Card](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/cards/card) - contains `CardComponent` - a draggable card with some text information.
    * [MultiPane](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane) - the Multi-Pane tab, it displays `ArticleListComponent` and `ArticleDetailsComponent` components either in a stack (one on top of another) or side by side. **Please note that this sample is for advanced single-pane/multi-pane navigation and layout, for generic master-detail navigation please refer to the Sample Todo List App described below.**
        * [ArticleListComponent](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane/list) - displays a random list of articles. Clicking on an item triggers the `ArticleDetails` component.
        * [ArticleDetailsComponent](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane/details) - displays the content of the selected article.
    * [DynamicFeatures](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/dynamicfeatures) - the Dynamic Features tab, it demonstrates the usage of [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery) on Android, while using classing integration on other platforms. There are two simple feature components - `Feature1` and `Feature2` - they are located in separate modules described below.
        * [DynamicFeature](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/dynamicfeatures/dynamicfeature) - a helper component responsible for loading dynamic feature components.
* [compose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/compose) - this module contains Jetpack Compose UI.
* [dynamic-features/api](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/api) - this module contains only API for dynamic feature components.
* [dynamic-features/compose-api](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature1Impl) - this module contains only Jetpack Compose API for dynamic feature components.
* [dynamic-features/feature1Impl](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature1Impl) - contains the implementation of `Feature1` dynamic feature component. On Android it depends on `android-app` module and is used via reflection. On all other targets, the `shared` module directly depends on this module and no reflection is used.
* [dynamic-features/feature2Impl](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature2Impl) - contains the implementation of `Feature2` dynamic feature component. On Android it depends on `android-app` module and is used via reflection. On all other targets, the `shared` module directly depends on this module and no reflection is used.
* [Android sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-android)
* [Desktop sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-desktop)
* [iOS sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-ios)
* [Web (JS) sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-js)
* Tests
    * [RootComponentIntegrationTest](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/root/RootComponentIntegrationTest.kt) - integration tests for `RootComponent`, including navigation tests.
    * [CountersComponentIntegrationTest](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters/CountersComponentIntegrationTest.kt) - integration tests for `CountersComponent`, including navigation tests.
    * [CounterComponentTest](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters/counter/CounterComponentTest.kt) - unit tests for `CounterComponent`. Includes supplying test dependencies, tests for instance retaining and state preservation, etc.
    * [CounterContentTest](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/compose/src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters/counter/CounterContentTest.kt) - UI tests (Jetpack Compose) for `CounterComponent`.

!!!warning
    The Multi-Pane sample is only for advanced single-pane/multi-pane navigation and layout. For generic master-detail navigation please refer to the Sample Todo List App described below.
