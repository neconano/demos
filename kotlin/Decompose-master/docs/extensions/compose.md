# Extensions for Jetpack/JetBrains Compose

Extensions and utilities for easier integration of Decompose with Jetpack/JetBrains Compose.

## Setup

Please see the corresponding [Installation docs section](/Decompose/getting-started/installation/#extensions-for-jetpackjetbrains-compose).

#### ProGuard rules for Compose for Desktop (JVM)

If you support Compose for Desktop, you will need to add the following rule for ProGuard, so that the app works correctly in release mode. See [Minification & obfuscation](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/tutorials/Native_distributions_and_local_execution#minification--obfuscation) section in Compose docs for more information.

## Content

As mentioned above both modules provide similar functionality. Most of the links in this document refer to the Jetpack module, however there usually a mirror in the JetBrains module.

### Converting Value to State

To convert Decompose [Value](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/decompose/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/decompose/value) to Compose `State` use `Value<T>.subscribeAsState(): State<T>` extension function:

```kotlin
interface SomeComponent {
    val model: Value<Model>

    data class Model(/*...*/)
}

@Composable
fun SomeContent(component: SomeComponent) {
    val model: State<Model> by component.model.subscribeAsState()
}
```

### Controlling the Lifecycle on Desktop

When using JetBrains Compose, you can have a `LifecycleRegistry` react to changes in the window state using the `LifecycleController()` composable. This will trigger appropriate lifecycle events when the window is minimized, restored or closed.

It is also possible to manually start the lifecycle using `LifecycleRegistry.resume()` when the instance is created.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val lifecycle = LifecycleRegistry()
    val root = RootComponent(DefaultComponentContext(lifecycle))
    
    // Alternative: manually start the lifecycle (no reaction to window state)
    // lifecycle.resume()
    
    application {
        val windowState = rememberWindowState()
        
        // Bind the registry to the life cycle of the window
        LifecycleController(lifecycle, windowState)
        
        Window(state = windowState, ...) {
            // The rest of your content
        }
    }
}
```

!!!warning
    When using Compose in desktop platforms, make sure to always use one of the methods above, or your components might not receive lifecycle events correctly.

### Navigating between Composable components

The [Child Stack](/Decompose/navigation/stack/overview/) navigation model provides [ChildStack](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/blob/master/decompose/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/decompose/router/stack/ChildStack.kt) as `Value<ChildStack>` that can be observed in a `Composable` component. This makes it possible to switch child `Composable` components following the `ChildStack` changes.

Both Compose extension modules provide the [Children(...)](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/blob/master/extensions-compose-jetbrains/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/decompose/extensions/compose/jetbrains/stack/Children.kt) function which has the following features:

- It listens for the `ChildStack` changes and displays the corresponding child `Composable` component using the provided slot lambda.
- It preserves components' UI state (e.g. scrolling position) in the back stack and over configuration changes and process death.
- It animates between children if there is an `animation` spec provided.

Here is an example of switching child components on navigation:

```kotlin
// Root

interface RootComponent {
    val childStack: Value<ChildStack<*, Child>>

    sealed class Child {
        data class MainChild(val component: MainComponent) : Child()
        data class DetailsChild(val component: DetailsComponent) : Child()
    }
}

@Composable
fun RootContent(rootComponent: RootComponent) {
    Children(rootComponent.childStack) {
        when (val child = it.instance) {
            is MainChild -> MainContent(child.component)
            is DetailsChild -> DetailsContent(child.component)
        }
    }
}

// Children

interface MainComponent

interface DetailsComponent

@Composable
fun MainContent(component: MainComponent) {
    // Omitted code
}

@Composable
fun DetailsContent(component: DetailsComponent) {
    // Omitted code
}
```

### Pager-like navigation

!!!warning
    This navigation model is experimental, the API is subject to change.

The [Child Pages](/Decompose/navigation/pages/overview/) navigation model provides [ChildPages](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/blob/master/decompose/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/decompose/router/pages/ChildPages.kt) as `Value<ChildPages>` that can be observed in a `Composable` component.

Both Compose extension modules provide the [Pages(...)](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/blob/master/extensions-compose-jetbrains/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/decompose/extensions/compose/jetbrains/pages/Pages.kt) function which has the following features:

- It listens for the `ChildPages` changes and displays child components using `HorizontalPager` or `VerticalPager` (see the related Jetpack Compose [documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/pager)).
- It animates page changes if there is an `animation` spec provided.

```kotlin title="Example"
@Composable
fun PagesContent(component: PagesComponent) {
    Pages(
        pages = component.pages,
        onPageSelected = component::selectPage,
        scrollAnimation = PagesScrollAnimation.Default,
    ) { _, page ->
        PageContent(page)
    }
}

@Composable
fun PageContent(component: PageComponent) {
    // Omitted code
}
```

### Animations

Decompose provides [Child Animation API](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/extensions-compose-jetpack/src/main/java/com/arkivanov/decompose/extensions/compose/jetpack/stack/animation) for Compose, as well as some predefined animation specs. To enable child animations you need to pass the `animation` argument to the `Children` function. There are predefined animators provided by Decompose.

#### Fade animation

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation(fade()),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkivanov/Decompose/master/docs/media/ComposeAnimationFade.gif" width="512">

#### Slide animation

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation(slide()),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkivanov/Decompose/master/docs/media/ComposeAnimationSlide.gif" width="512">

#### Combining animators

It is also possible to combine animators using the `plus` operator. Please note that the order matters - the right animator is applied after the left animator.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation(fade() + scale())
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkivanov/Decompose/master/docs/media/ComposeAnimationFadeScale.gif" width="512">

#### Separate animations for children

Previous examples demonstrate simple cases, when all children have the same animation. But it is also possible to specify separate animations for children.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation { child ->
            when (child.instance) {
                is MainChild -> fade() + scale()
                is DetailsChild -> fade() + slide()
            }
        }
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkivanov/Decompose/master/docs/media/ComposeAnimationSeparate.gif" width="512">

It is also possible to take into account the other child and the animation direction when selecting the animation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation { child, otherChild, direction ->
            // Select and return an animator here
        }
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

#### Custom animations

It is also possible to define custom animations.

Implementing `StackAnimation` manually. This is the most flexible low-level API. The animation block receives the current `ChildStack` and animates children using the provided `content` slot.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = rootComponent.childStack,
        animation = someAnimation(),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}

fun <C : Any, T : Any> someAnimation(): StackAnimation<C, T> =
    StackAnimation { stack: ChildStack<C, T>,
                     modifier: Modifier,
                     content: @Composable (Child.Created<C, T>) -> Unit ->
        // Render each frame here
    }
```

Using the `stackAnimation` helper function and implementing `StackAnimator`. The `stackAnimation` function takes care of tracking the `ChildStack` changes. `StackAnimator` is only responsible for manipulating the `Modifier` in the given `direction`, and calling `onFinished` at the end.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation(someAnimator()),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}

fun someAnimator(): StackAnimator =
    StackAnimator { direction: Direction,
                    isInitial: Boolean,
                    onFinished: () -> Unit,
                    content: @Composable (Modifier) -> Unit ->
        // Manipulate the Modifier in the given direction and call onFinished at the end
    }
```

Using `stackAnimation` and `stackAnimator` helper functions. This is the simplest, but less powerful way. The `stackAnimator` function takes care of running the animation. Its block has a very limited responsibility - to render the current frame using the provided `factor` and `direction`.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = component.childStack,
        animation = stackAnimation(someAnimator()),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}

fun someAnimator(): StackAnimator =
    stackAnimator { factor: Float,
                    direction: Direction,
                    content: (Modifier) -> Unit ->
        // Render the current frame
    }
```

Please refer to the predefined animators (`fade`, `slide`, etc.) for implementation examples.

### Predictive Back Gesture

!!!warning
    Predictive Back Gesture support is experimental, the API is subject to change. For now, please use version 2.1.x.

`Child Stack` supports the new [Android Predictive Back Gesture](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture) on all platforms. To enable the gesture, first implement `BackHandlerOwner` interface in your component with `Child Stack`, then just pass `predictiveBackAnimation` to the `Children` function.

```kotlin title="RootComponent"
interface RootComponent : BackHandlerOwner {
    val stack: Value<ChildStack<...>>

    fun onBackClicked()
}

class DefaultRootComponent(
    componentContext: ComponentContext,
) : ComponentContext by componentContext, BackHandlerOwner {
    // ComponentContext already implements BackHandlerOwner, no need to implement it separately

    // Omitted body

    override fun onBackClicked() {
        navigation.pop()
    }
}
```

```kotlin title="RootContent"
@Composable
fun RootContent(component: RootComponent) {
    Children(
        stack = rootComponent.childStack,
        animation = predictiveBackAnimation(
            backHandler = component.backHandler,
            animation = stackAnimation(fade() + scale()), // Your usual animation here
            onBack = component::onBackClicked,
        ),
    ) {
        // Omitted code
    }
}
```

#### Predictive Back Gesture on Android

On Android, the predictive back gesture only works starting with Android T. On Android T, it works only between Activities, if enabled in the system settings. Starting with Android U, the predictive back gesture can be enabled between `Child Stack` screens inside a single Activity.

#### Predictive Back Gesture on other platforms

On all other platforms, the predictive back gesture can be enabled by showing a special overlay that automatically handles the gesture and manipulates `BackDispatcher` as needed.

<video width="192" autoplay loop muted><source src="/Decompose/media/BackGestureIos.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

```kotlin title="Initialising the root component"
val lifecycle = LifecycleRegistry()
val backDispatcher = BackDispatcher()

val componentContext = 
    DefaultComponentContext(
        lifecycle = lifecycle,
        backHandler = backDispatcher, // Pass BackDispatcher here
    )
    
val root = DefaultRootComponent(componentContext = componentContext)
```

```kotlin title="Using Composable PredictiveBackGestureOverlay"
PredictiveBackGestureOverlay(
    backDispatcher = backDispatcher, // Use the same BackDispatcher as above
    backIcon = { progress, _ ->
        PredictiveBackGestureIcon(
            imageVector = Icons.Default.ArrowBack,
            progress = progress,
        )
    },
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
) {
    RootContent(
        component = root,
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    )
}
```

## Compose for iOS, macOS and Web (Canvas)

Compose for iOS, macOS and Web (Canvas) is still work in progress and was not officially announced. However, Decompose already supports it. The support is also **experimental** and is not part of the main branch - see [#74](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/issues/74) for more information.

If you want to use Decompose with Compose for iOS/macOS/Web, you have to use special versions of both `decompose` and `extensions-compose-jetbrains` modules.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    implementation "com.arkivanov.decompose:decompose:<version>-compose-experimental"
    implementation "com.arkivanov.decompose:extensions-compose-jetbrains:<version>-compose-experimental"
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    implementation("com.arkivanov.decompose:decompose:<version>-compose-experimental")
    implementation("com.arkivanov.decompose:extensions-compose-jetbrains:<version>-compose-experimental")
    ```

### Samples

You can find samples in a separate branch - [compose-darwin/sample/app-darwin-compose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/compose-experimental/sample).
