## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to our team. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing the issue and helping us ensure the security and integrity of our project.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Option 1: Email** - Send an email to [myofficework000@gmail.com](mailto:myofficework000@gmail.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report".

2. **Option 2: Issue Tracker** - Submit a new issue with the "Security Vulnerability" label in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/myofficework000/Jetpack-Compose-All-In-One-Guide/issues).

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please provide as much information as possible, including:

- A brief description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.

## Handling of Vulnerability Reports

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will:

3. Work on fixing the vulnerability and releasing an appropriate patch.

4. Maintain communication with the reporter to provide updates on the progress and resolution of the vulnerability.

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that you do not disclose any details of the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it. Once we have addressed the reported vulnerability, we encourage responsible disclosure, and we will attribute the reporter in the release notes or security advisory, if desired.
